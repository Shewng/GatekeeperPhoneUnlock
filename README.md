# GatekeeperPhoneUnlock
CPSC 581 Winter 2020 Project 1

Created by Katie Tieu and Sam Wong

This program is a touch-based design alternative to "slide to unlock". Users must choose from five different actions to get the phone gatekeeper to let them in (i.e. unlock the phone).

# Run
1. Clone/download the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Build > Clean Project
4. Connect an Android device via USB cable (see https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app), or set up an emulator
5. Run > Run 'app'
6. Tap the action buttons on the app to get different reactions from the sheep gatekeeper
7. Some actions will anger the gatekeeper and cause it to lock the user out of the phone for 10 seconds. Any state changes of the interaction will reset after this (i.e. the user will start a brand new confrontation with the gatekeeper)
8. Some actions might change the gatekeeper's reactions, but are useless until certain requirements have been met
